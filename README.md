# Wrench Project Template

## What is This Repository?

This repository serves as a **GitHub template** for Python-based AWS projects. A GitHub template repository is a special kind of repository that you can use to generate new repositories with an existing directory structure and files. This enables you to kick-start new projects without having to set up a new repository from scratch.

## How to Use This GitHub Template

1. **Navigate to the Template Repository**: Go to the GitHub page of this template repository.
2. **Use this Template**: Click the "Use this template" button, usually located near the top right corner of the repository page. This will create a new repository that includes all the files and folders from this template repository.
3. **Configure Your New Repository**: You'll be prompted to name your new repository and set some initial settings. You can also choose whether to include all branches or just the default branch from the template repository.
4. **Create Repository from Template**: Once you've configured your new repository, click the "Create repository from template" button. This will create a new repository under your GitHub account, pre-populated with the files from this template repository.
5. **Clone and Modify**: Now, you can clone this new repository to your local machine and start modifying it as needed. All the essential files and directory structures are already set up for you.
