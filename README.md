## Logger Documentation

### Overview

The `BaseLogger` class provides a flexible and powerful logging system that supports console and file logging, colored output, custom log levels, and various configurations tailored to different environments, such as AWS Lambda. The `Logger` class extends `BaseLogger`, adding convenience methods for logging messages with different severity levels and modes.

### Key Features

- **Console and File Logging:** Logs can be sent to the console and optionally to a file.
- **Custom Log Levels:** Supports standard log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.) and custom levels (CONTEXT, HDL_WARN, FLOW, etc.).
- **Colored Output:** When `colorama` is available, logs can be displayed with colors for enhanced readability; otherwise, non-colored output is used.
- **Traceback Logging:** Supports detailed stack traces for errors and custom log formatting options.
- **Lambda Awareness:** Configurations adjust automatically when running on AWS Lambda or can be manually overridden.
- **Verbose and Non-Verbose Modes:** Toggle between detailed logging and more concise outputs.
- **Session Management:** Easily generate new run IDs to differentiate log sessions.

---

### BaseLogger Class

#### Constructor

```python
def __init__(self, level: str = 'INFO') -> None
```

- **`level`**: Sets the initial logging level. Acceptable values include 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', and 'CRITICAL'.

#### Methods

1. **`log_file(path: str) -> None`**
   - Configures the logger to dump logs to a specified file while also continuing to log to the console.
   - **`path`**: The path to the file where logs should be saved.

2. **`release_log_file() -> None`**
   - Stops logging to the file and releases the resources associated with the file handler.

3. **`suppress_package_logger(package_name: str, level: int = logging.CRITICAL) -> None`**
   - Suppresses logging for a specific package, setting its log level to the specified level. Adds a `NullHandler` to prevent propagation to the root logger if none exists.
   - **`package_name`**: The name of the package logger to suppress.
   - **`level`**: The logging level to set for the package logger. Defaults to `CRITICAL`.

4. **`setLevel(level: str) -> None`**
   - Changes the reporting level of the logger and updates the levels of existing console and file handlers.
   - **`level`**: The desired logging level as a string (e.g., 'DEBUG', 'INFO', etc.).

5. **`set_verbose(verbose: bool) -> None`**
   - Toggles between verbose and non-verbose mode.
   - **`verbose`**: If `True`, enables verbose logging with file, function, and line details; otherwise, switches to a concise format.

6. **`set_global_traceback(setting: bool) -> None`**
   - Enables or disables global stack trace logging for all error logs.
   - **`setting`**: If `True`, forces stack traces to be included in error logs.

7. **`revertLoggingLevel() -> None`**
   - Reverts the logging level to the previously set level. If no previous level is saved, it defaults to `INFO`.

8. **`overwrite_lambda_mode(setting: bool) -> None`**
   - Manually sets whether the logger should behave as if it's running on AWS Lambda, affecting logging format and settings.
   - **`setting`**: If `True`, forces the logger to operate in Lambda mode.

9. **`initiate_new_run() -> None`**
   - Generates a new run ID, useful for differentiating log sessions.

### Logger Class

The `Logger` class extends `BaseLogger`, adding specialized methods for logging different levels of messages. Each method allows for optional stack trace inclusion and compact formatting.

#### Key Methods

1. **`info(*args: Any, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, compact: Optional[bool] = True) -> None`**
   - Logs an informational message.
   - **`stack_info`**: If `True`, includes stack trace information.
   - **`compact`**: If `True`, formats the log message compactly.

2. **`flow(*args: Any, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, compact: Optional[bool] = True) -> None`**
   - Logs a message at the FLOW level (custom).

3. **`context(*args: Any, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, compact: Optional[bool] = True) -> None`**
   - Logs a contextual message at the CONTEXT level (custom).

4. **`warning(*args: Any, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, compact: Optional[bool] = True) -> None`**
   - Logs a warning message.

5. **`error(*args: Any, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, compact: Optional[bool] = False) -> None`**
   - Logs an error message, including stack traces if an exception is detected among the arguments. If an exception is present, `stack_info` is automatically set to `True`.

6. **`critical(*args: Any, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, compact: Optional[bool] = False) -> None`**
   - Logs a critical message indicating severe issues.

7. **`debug(*args: Any, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, compact: Optional[bool] = False) -> None`**
   - Logs debugging information.

8. **`data(data: Any, object_name: Optional[str] = None, content: Optional[bool] = True, wrap_length: Optional[int] = None, max_rows: Optional[int] = None, stack_info: Optional[bool] = False, indent: Optional[int] = 4) -> None`**
   - Formats and logs structured data, such as dictionaries or DataFrames. Supports wrapping and formatting based on verbosity settings.

9. **`start_time() -> None`**
   - Starts a timer for tracking elapsed time between log calls.

10. **`log_time(message: str = "Elapsed time", format: str = "seconds", stack_info: Optional[bool] = False) -> None`**
    - Logs the elapsed time since the timer was started, checking if the timer was initiated correctly.
    - **`format`**: Specifies the time format, either "seconds" or "formatted".

11. **`header(text: str, size: int = 80, newline: bool = True) -> None`**
    - Logs a formatted header with optional color and centering using dashes (`-`).

### Logging Modes and Settings

1. **Verbose vs. Non-Verbose Mode:**
   - Use `set_verbose(True)` to enable detailed log messages with file, function, and line details.
   - Use `set_verbose(False)` for concise log messages, primarily showing level, timestamp, and message.

2. **AWS Lambda Mode:**
   - Detected automatically when running in AWS Lambda (`'AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME' in os.environ`).
   - Can be manually overridden using `overwrite_lambda_mode(True/False)`.

3. **Logging Levels:**
   - Supports standard levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.
   - Custom levels: CONTEXT, HDL_WARN, DATA, FLOW, HDL_ERR, and RCV_ERR, with specialized uses. Custom levels are integrated using `logging.addLevelName`.

4. **File Logging:**
   - Easily configured with `log_file(path)`. Logs are written to the specified file and printed to the console.
   - Stopped and resources released with `release_log_file()`.

5. **Package-Specific Log Suppression:**
   - Suppress noisy package loggers using `suppress_package_logger('package_name')`. Adds a `NullHandler` if none exist.

6. **Session Management:**
   - Use `initiate_new_run()` to generate a new run ID, useful for differentiating log sessions.

7. **Colored Output:**
   - If `colorama` is available, log messages are colorized for better readability. Fallbacks to non-colored output if `colorama` is not installed.

### Example Usage

```python
# Initialize Logger
logger = Logger()

# Configure file logging
logger.log_file('logs/application.log')

# Log messages
logger.info("Application started")
logger.debug("Debugging information")
logger.error("An error occurred", stack_info=True)

# Suppress a noisy package logger
logger.suppress_package_logger('noisy_package')

# Stop file logging and release resources
logger.release_log_file()
```
