    """
    Validates that each entry in a dictionary or a list of dictionaries matches the expected type.

    Args:
        data: A dictionary or a list of dictionaries to validate.
        expected_types: A dictionary mapping parameter names to the expected types. Each type can be a single type or a list of types.
        none_is_ok: If True, allows None as a valid value.
        errors: A string that determines the error handling strategy. If set to 'raise', the function will raise a TypeError when a mismatch is found.
                If set to 'coerce', the function will attempt to coerce the value to the expected type.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If any parameter does not match the expected type and 'errors' is set to 'raise'.
        ValueError: If any required parameter is missing.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the data is valid, False otherwise.

    Usage example:
        >>> from WrenchCL.Tools import typechecker

        >>> data = [
        >>>     {"name": "John", "age": 30},
        >>>     {"name": "Jane", "age": "twenty"}
        >>> ]
        >>> expected_types = {"name": str, "age": int}

        >>> try:
        >>>     result = typechecker(data, expected_types, none_is_ok=False, errors='raise')
        >>>     print("Data is valid:", result)
        >>> except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
        >>>     print(f"Validation failed: {e}")

        # This will raise a TypeError because the age of "Jane" is not an int
